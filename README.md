# Welcome to My IBM Final Project!!

This project involves guided scenarios aimed at completing the IBM Data Analyst Certificate. 
Assuming the role of a Data Analyst within a prominent international IT and business consulting firm renowned for its expertise in IT solutions, 
I am tasked with analyzing data to predict future skill demands and maintain competitiveness amidst fast-evolving technologies. 
My responsibilities include gathering information from various sources and identifying trends for this year's skills development report.

Week 1: 
Data Collection

My initial objective is to collect data on the most sought-after programming skills from job postings, training platforms, and surveys, among other channels. 
I will employ techniques such as web scraping and API utilization to gather data in various formats including .csv files, Excel sheets, and databases.

Week 2: 
Data Wrangling

I will utilize data wrangling techniques to prepare the collected data for analysis.

Week 3: 
Exploratory Data Analysis

Once sufficient data has been retrieved and cleaned, I will employ statistical methods to delve into the data.

Week 4: 
Data Visualization

This phase involves creating visual representations such as charts and graphs to elucidate insights from the data.

Week 5: 
Dashboard Development

Using IBM Cognos Analytics, I will construct a dashboard to consolidate all the data and identify trends and insights. 
This may involve answering questions such as:
the current demand for programming languages, the most sought-after database skills, and the popularity of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs).

Week 6: 
presentation of findings

I use storytelling to share my findings in a presentation.
